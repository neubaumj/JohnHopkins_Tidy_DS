Code Book of Details Steps in Processing the Data
==================
The data was processed using a scrip named run_analysis.R

The processing steps included:

Downloaded the data and uncompressed the zip file placed into default R directory</br>
Read in the data (see Processing Files and Directory Structure)</br>
Appended together Training and Test data sets</br>
Renamed columns to the ones listed in the features.txt file and cleaned up labels</br>
Joined the datasets (x, y and activities) into 1 data set</br>
Saved data set to file joined.txt</br>
Grouped data set by Activity and Subject ID</br>
Saved data set to file summarized.txt</br>


Processed output files
==================
Joined ".\joined.txt"</br>
Summarized ".\summarized.txt"
